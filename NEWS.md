# snprcspf 1.1.7.9000 (20200613)

  - Added some better description of fmt\_luminex\_results().

# snprcspf 1.1.7 (20200612)

  - Corrected bug in fmt\_luminex\_results() that was saving the data
    used to control formating of the worksheet to the worksheet instead
    of the dataframe that was supposed to be written. Some refactoring
    of code was also done to make the side effects of the function more
    easily understood.

# snprcspf 1.1.6 (20200406)

  - Changed default blank replacement from “.” to " " in calls to
    read.xlsx(). The period were causing the column match routines to
    fail.

# snprcspf 1.1.5 (20200403)

  - Changed positive cell markup to yellow characters and red background
  - Changed to a conditional test for NA delimited columns of the
    divisor data. read\_excel, which had been used, always added NA
    values. read.xlsx does not.

# snprcspf 1.1.2 (20200330)

  - Used `suppressMessages` on `read_excel` to suppress the New Name
    messages

# snprcspf 1.1.1 (20200329)

  - Moved misplaced unit test file.

# snprcspf 1.1.0 (20200328)

  - Have replaced dependence on Java for the Excel formatting. Using
    openxlsx package
  - Have cleaned up code for file name and file path management for the
    Excel input file names and paths

# snprcspf 1.0.9 (20200321)

  - Copied build instructions from nprcgenekeepr
  - Removed redundant copy of a function.

# snprcspf 1.0.8 (20200321)

  - Separated R code into seperate files for each function.
  - Created some data objects for testing and demonstration. This has
    created a dependency on R \>= 3.5.0.

# snprcspf 1.0.7 (20190526)

  - Removed formating of Excel sheets to remove dependency on rJava used
    by XLConnect. As of 2019 May 26, Java 12 has a bug  that prevents
    the use of the XLConnect package. This version of snprcspf has
    removed that dependency with the side effect of not providing
    formating within the Excel workbook generated.
